# What is it?
This script toggles a workspace.
In contrast to the standard i3 toggle behaviour, this script will restore your active displays.

## Example
In this example the setup consists of 3 monitors with workspaces 1 to 3 active.

### Normal Behaviour:

       (active)
          |
          V
| 1 | 2 | 3 |

|  $mod + 4 
V




# Installation
Copy the script to a directory in your path, for example `~/.local/bin`.
```
cp toggle_workspace.sh ~/.local/bin
```
After that you can use it in your i3 config.
Example:
```
bindsym $mod+9 exec bash toggle_workspace.sh 9
```
