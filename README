# What is it?
This script toggles a workspace.
In contrast to the standard i3 toggle behaviour, this script will restore your active workspaces.


# Example
In this example the setup consists of 3 monitors with workspaces 1 to 3 active.

## Normal behaviour:

                   |  1  |  2  |  3  |
                               (active)
                   
                   |  $mod + 4 
                   V
                   
                   |  4  |  2  |  3  |
                   (active)
                   
                   |  $mod + 3 
                   V
                   
                   |  4  |  2  |  3  |
                               (active)
                   
## Behaviour using this script:
                   
                   |  1  |  2  |  3  |
                               (active)
                   
                   |  toggle_workspace.sh 4 
                   V
                   
                   |  4  |  2  |  3  |
                   (active)
                   
                   |  toggle_workspace.sh 3 
                   V
                   
                   |  1  |  2  |  3  |
                               (active)
                   
                   

# Installation
Copy the script to a directory in your path, for example `~/.local/bin`.
```
cp toggle_workspace.sh ~/.local/bin
```
After that you can use it in your i3 config.
Example:
```
bindsym $mod+9 exec bash toggle_workspace.sh 9
```
